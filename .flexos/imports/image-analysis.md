## Asset Triage Summary
Quick stats:
*   Total Images: 0
*   KEEP: 0
*   REMAKE: 0
*   REPLACE: 0
*   DITCH: 0

## Logo
No logo was found in the initial image analysis. We need to determine if a logo exists elsewhere (e.g., style guide, vector files) and its current state.  If a logo doesn't exist, or is of poor quality, it should be a priority to design one.

## Hero Candidates
No images identified as potential hero candidates.  We will need to source or create imagery appropriate for impactful website hero sections.

## Authentic Content (KEEP)
No authentic content was identified. A key priority for the redesign should be to gather real photos of the team, office, products, and the company's work. This is vital for establishing trust and credibility.

## Needs Replacement
Since no images exist in the initial dataset, there are no images needing replacement.  However, the future website will undoubtedly require imagery, and we should strive to *avoid* stock photography whenever possible, opting instead for original, high-quality visuals.

## Ditch Pile
No images were identified for the ditch pile.
