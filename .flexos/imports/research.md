### **Website Redesign Research: test.com**

**Project Goal:** Synthesize existing data to inform the design and development of a new, better-performing website. This document is a practical foundation for content strategy, design, and SEO.

---

### **1. Business Facts**

*   **Company Name:** Bergmann Ingenieure GmbH.
*   **Core Services:** Specializes in planning, installation, and maintenance of industrial HVAC systems (referred to as "RLT-Anlagen" or "Lüftungstechnik"). Their target market appears to be manufacturing and industrial facilities.
*   **Location:** Confirmed address in Berlin, Germany via Google Business Profile.
*   **Team Size:** LinkedIn indicates 12 employees. The company was founded by Klaus Bergmann.
*   **History:** The website "About Us" page states the company was founded in 1998.

### **2. Content Worth Keeping**

These are valuable assets that build trust and credibility. They must be migrated and featured prominently in the new design.

*   **Testimonial:** A positive quote exists from a client named "Schmidt Manufacturing." This is authentic social proof.
*   **Partnership:** The 2019 press release mentions a collaboration with Siemens on a "Factory 4.0" project. This is a very strong credibility signal.
*   **Certification:** They hold a TÜV SÜD certification, a key trust mark in German engineering. This should be displayed with the official logo.
*   **Project History:** The existing "Projekte" (Projects) page, while outdated, contains the raw information for what could become powerful case studies. The list of past work is an asset.

### **3. SEO Intelligence**

*   **Ranking Keywords:**
    *   **High Rank:** Brand name ("Bergmann Ingenieure GmbH").
    *   **Medium Rank:** Specific, technical German terms like "industrielle lüftungsanlagen" and "RLT-Anlagen Wartung Berlin".
    *   **Low/No Rank:** Broader, English-language, or high-level business terms like "industrial ventilation solutions" or "factory air quality control." There is a significant opportunity here.
*   **Top Traffic Pages:**
    1.  Homepage
    2.  `/projekte` (Projects)
    3.  `/kontakt` (Contact)
    *This is a typical traffic distribution for a simple B2B site, indicating users are either verifying the company's existence or looking for proof of work before contacting them.*
*   **Google Business Profile (GBP):**
    *   The profile is claimed and has correct contact information.
    *   It lacks any recent posts, Q&As, or service listings.
    *   Photos appear to be old.
    *   Reviews are mixed (one 5-star, one 3-star). The 3-star review mentions "slow communication."

### **4. Competitive Landscape**

*   **Key Competitors (from SERPs for "industrial HVAC systems Berlin"):**
    1.  **Klima-Kraft AG:** Presents as "Modern & Efficient Industrial Climate Control." Their messaging is benefit-driven and focuses on efficiency.
    2.  **AeroTech Solutions:** Presents as "Sustainable HVAC Solutions for Industry." Their messaging targets a modern value (sustainability).
*   **Analysis:** Competitors use benefit-oriented, modern language. Bergmann's current site title is "Bergmann Ingenieure - Experts in Lüftungstechnik," which is descriptive but less compelling. Competitors appear to be targeting a broader management audience, not just engineers.

### **5. Voice & Language**

*   **Tone:** Highly formal, technical, and traditional. The language is dense with industry-specific acronyms (RLT-Anlagen).
*   **Language:** The site is primarily German. The English version is incomplete and appears to be poorly auto-translated, which is worse than having no English version at all.
*   **Audience Assumption:** The current site speaks to an audience that already has deep technical knowledge. It is not accessible to a facilities manager, CFO, or procurement officer who may be the ultimate decision-maker.

### **6. Missing Pieces**

These are critical gaps and opportunities for the new website to address.

*   **Professional Team Page:** There is no way to see the expertise of the 12 employees. A page with key personnel, their qualifications, and photos would build significant trust.
*   **Detailed Case Studies:** The "Projekte" page is a list. A modern site needs 2-3 detailed case studies that outline the client's **Problem**, Bergmann's **Solution**, and the measurable **Result** (e.g., energy savings, downtime reduction).
*   **Clear Value Proposition:** The current site explains *what* they do, but not *why* a client should choose them. The new site needs a clear, prominent message about their unique strengths (e.g., specialization in a niche, superior process, 20+ years of experience).
*   **Thought Leadership (Blog/Insights):** There is no content to capture potential clients earlier in the buying journey. A blog with articles like "5 Signs Your Factory's HVAC System Needs an Upgrade" would attract relevant search traffic.
*   **Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** The only CTA is "Contact Us." The new site should include CTAs like "Request a Consultation," "Download Our Process Guide," or "See Our Work."

### **7. Red Flags**

These issues damage credibility and must be fixed in the redesign.

*   **Outdated Information:** The website footer copyright is "© 2018." This immediately signals the site is neglected.
*   **Inconsistent Branding:** The logo on the LinkedIn Company Page is a newer, more modern version than the one on the website. All digital properties must be synchronized.
*   **Broken English Version:** The poor quality of the English translation is a major liability. It makes the company look unprofessional to any international visitor.
*   **No Mobile Optimization:** The site performs poorly on mobile devices, which is unacceptable for a modern web presence.
