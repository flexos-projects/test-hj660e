## Company Profile & Redesign Strategy: Internet Systems Consortium (ISC)

**PREFACE:** The initial research query for "Test (test.com)" revealed a critical finding: **test.com is not a commercial entity.** It is a reserved domain that currently redirects to **isc.org**, the website for the **Internet Systems Consortium (ISC)**. Therefore, this entire profile and redesign strategy is focused on the real entity, ISC.

---

### The Business (facts only)

*   **Company Name:** Internet Systems Consortium (ISC)
*   **Legal Entity:** 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
*   **History:** Founded in 1994, with roots in developing core internet software that dates back even further. They have been operating for nearly 30 years as a foundational pillar of internet infrastructure.
*   **What They Do:** ISC develops, maintains, and supports critical, open-source internet software. Their primary products are **BIND 9**, the most widely used Domain Name System (DNS) software, and **Kea**, a modern Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. They also contribute to internet standards and protocols.
*   **Location / Service Area:** ISC is a global organization. Their software is deployed on servers in every country, and they provide professional support and training services to clients worldwide.

### The Story

The narrative for ISC is that of the **"Unsung Architects of the Internet."**

They are not a flashy startup or a profit-driven corporation. They are the quiet, trusted, and deeply technical stewards of the internet's foundational plumbing. For decades, their BIND software has been the engine that translates human-readable domain names (like `google.com`) into the IP addresses that computers use to communicate. It is difficult to overstate their impact; a significant portion of the global internet relies on their code every single second.

As a non-profit, their mission is not to enrich shareholders but to ensure the stability, security, and openness of the internet for everyone. They are a small, dedicated team of world-class experts whose work has a massive global footprint. This is a story of legacy, responsibility, and profound technical expertise.

### What They're Known For

ISC's reputation is not built on Google reviews or social media buzz, but on decades of trust within the technical community.

*   **Foundational Technology:** They are the creators and maintainers of BIND, the de facto standard for DNS servers for much of the internet's history. This gives them unparalleled authority and credibility.
*   **Technical Excellence & Reliability:** Their software is known for being robust and standards-compliant, designed for mission-critical, high-performance environments.
*   **Open-Source Commitment:** They are a pillar of the open-source community, providing free and accessible software that powers the world.
*   **Thought Leadership:** ISC actively participates in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and other standards bodies, helping to shape the future of internet protocols.
*   **Premium Enterprise Support:** For organizations that cannot afford downtime (ISPs, large corporations, governments), ISC is known for providing expert-level, direct-from-the-source technical support for their software.

### The Competitive Reality

ISC operates in a unique niche of non-profit, open-source infrastructure development.

*   **Industry Standard for Websites:** The industry is mixed. Some competitors have dated, purely functional websites (e.g., DNSmasq), while others have modern, professional, and well-designed online presences (e.g., NLnet Labs, PowerDNS, The Internet Society). The trend is clearly toward modern, clean, and informative sites.
*   **ISC's Current Position:** ISC's current website (`isc.org`) is functional but does not visually match the modernity or professionalism of its top-tier competitors. It successfully serves technical information but falls short of conveying their immense legacy and authority in a compelling, modern way.
*   **The Opportunity:** A website redesign is a massive opportunity for ISC to **visually reclaim its leadership position.** They have the history and the impact; a modern website will signal that they are also the future. The goal is not just to "catch up" but to set the standard for how a foundational internet organization should present itself online.

### Content Goldmine

The redesign can be built on a wealth of authentic, high-value content.

*   **Core Software Assets:** BIND and Kea are the stars. They need dedicated, clear sections for downloads, features, and documentation.
*   **Decades of History:** The story of BIND's role in the internet's growth is a powerful narrative that can be told through timelines, articles, and "About Us" content.
*   **Deep Technical Documentation:** This is the lifeblood for their community. It must be well-organized, searchable, and easy to navigate.
*   **Non-Profit Mission:** Their 501(c)(3) status is a key differentiator and trust signal that should be highlighted.
*   **Expert Team:** The credibility of their team is a major asset. Bios, blog posts, and conference talks can showcase this expertise.
*   **Enterprise Service Offerings:** The descriptions of their support contracts, training, and consulting services are the primary drivers of revenue and must be treated as premium B2B content.

### The Gaps

The current online presence has several clear gaps that the redesign must address.

*   **A Modern, Authoritative Design:** The current design does not reflect the organization's critical importance. It lacks the polish and user experience of a modern tech leader.
*   **A Clear, Compelling Narrative:** The "Unsung Architects" story is not being told effectively. The site feels more like a repository of technical files than the digital home of a world-changing organization.
*   **Distinct Audience Pathways:** The site serves two very different users: the open-source community member looking for a download/docs, and the enterprise CTO looking for a six-figure support contract. The current site does not effectively guide these two personas.
*   **Impact Storytelling:** There's a lack of clear, visual communication about their global scale and impact. Where is their software used? How many queries does it handle? This story is missing.

### Redesign Recommendations

This is not just a "facelift." This is a strategic project to build a digital headquarters that reflects ISC's true stature.

*   **The Goal:** Create an **Authoritative Digital Hub** for the internet infrastructure community. The site must instantly communicate trust, expertise, and modern relevance.

*   **The #1 Thing The New Site Must Communicate:**
    > **"We are the trusted, modern stewards of the internet's core infrastructure."**

*   **Core Features & Strategy:**
    1.  **Dual-Path Homepage Navigation:** The homepage must immediately and clearly segment the audience. Propose a prominent choice:
        *   **"For the Community"** (Open Source): Leads to downloads, documentation, mailing lists, and community resources.
        *   **"For the Enterprise"** (Professional Services): Leads to a polished, B2B-focused section detailing support contracts, training, and consulting, with clear calls-to-action like "Request a Quote" or "Contact Sales."
    2.  **"Our Impact" Showcase:** Create a dedicated, visually compelling section that tells the ISC story. Use a timeline of BIND's history, statistics on its global deployment, and case studies or testimonials from major organizations that rely on their software and support.
    3.  **World-Class Resource Library:** Overhaul the documentation section. Make it the gold standard for technical resources with powerful search, clear versioning, and intuitive navigation. This is non-negotiable for their core audience.
    4.  **Professional & Modern Aesthetics:** The design must be clean, responsive, and professional. It should take cues from the best-in-class competitor sites (NLnet Labs, The Internet Society) to project an image of a serious, well-run, and forward-looking organization.
    5.  **Humanize the Experts:** Feature the team more prominently. An "Our Experts" page with photos, bios, and links to their work will reinforce the message that clients and the community have access to the best minds in the field.
