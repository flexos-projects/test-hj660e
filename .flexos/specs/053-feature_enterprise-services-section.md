### Description

This feature focuses on creating a polished, professional, and persuasive set of pages dedicated to ISC's B2B offerings: Support, Training, and Consulting. The design and content will be tailored specifically to an enterprise audience, focusing on benefits like reliability, risk reduction, and access to expertise. This section is the primary conversion funnel for revenue-generating activities and must instill confidence and clearly articulate the value of ISC's commercial services.

### User Stories

-   **As an enterprise IT Manager,** I want to understand the business benefits of ISC's support, training, and consulting services, so I can build a strong business case for purchasing them.
-   **As a potential enterprise customer,** I want to see clear descriptions of the different support tiers and service offerings so I can determine which is the right fit for my organization's needs and budget.
-   **As a sales team member,** I want a professional set of pages to which I can direct potential clients that clearly communicates our value, showcases our expertise, and funnels them towards a quote request.

### Acceptance Criteria

-   A main landing page for "Enterprise Services" is created, providing an overview of all three service areas.
-   Dedicated sub-pages exist for:
    -   Support Services
    -   Training Services
    -   Consulting Services
-   The content on these pages uses benefit-oriented, persuasive language (e.g., "Maximize Uptime," "Mitigate Risk," "Develop Your Team's Expertise") rather than just listing features.
-   Each page includes clear, prominent calls-to-action (CTAs) that direct users to the High-Fidelity Quote Request Form.
-   The visual design of this section is professional, trustworthy, and visually aligned with a B2B audience.
-   The content for all services pages is easily editable by the marketing and sales teams via the CMS.
-   The section is fully responsive and provides an excellent user experience on all devices.

### Technical Notes

-   Create a reusable "Service Page" template in the CMS to ensure consistency and ease of content management.
-   Integrate analytics to track page views, CTA clicks, and user flow through this section to the quote request form.
-   This section is a prime candidate for including social proof elements like client logos or short testimonials once that content is available (see P2: Case Studies & Testimonials).
