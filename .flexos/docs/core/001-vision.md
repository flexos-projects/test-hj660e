title: 'Project Vision: The Digital Headquarters for Internet Infrastructure'
---

### 1. The Transformation

This project will transform `isc.org` from a functional, dated file repository into the **authoritative digital headquarters for internet infrastructure**. We are moving beyond a simple brochure for software and evolving into a platform that communicates ISC's monumental importance to the world. The current site serves its technical audience but fails to tell its own story. The new site will do both, seamlessly, projecting an image of quiet confidence, modern relevance, and unwavering trust. It will look and feel like the digital home of the people who built, and continue to steward, the internet's core.

### 2. Target Audiences & Their Needs

The new design is built around serving two primary, distinct personas:

*   **The Operator (Community Persona):** A senior network engineer at an ISP or a systems administrator at a university. She is highly technical, time-poor, and allergic to marketing fluff. She comes to the site with a specific goal: download the latest version of BIND, find precise documentation for a specific configuration, or check a mailing list archive. Her journey must be frictionless and fast.

*   **The Decision-Maker (Enterprise Persona):** A CTO at a Fortune 500 company or a VP of Infrastructure at a major telecommunications provider. He is responsible for mission-critical systems where downtime is measured in millions of dollars. He comes to the site seeking assurance. He needs to know that ISC is a stable, reliable partner with the world's foremost experts available 24/7. His journey must build confidence and provide a clear, professional path to engagement.

### 3. The First 3-Second Feeling

Upon arrival, a visitor should feel an immediate sense of **calm authority and trust**. The design will be clean, structured, and serious. The messaging will be direct and confident. There will be no doubt they have arrived at the definitive source. The feeling is not that of a flashy startup, but of a deeply established, world-class institution.

### 4. Success Metrics That Matter

We will measure success not by vanity metrics, but by tangible business and community goals:

*   **Primary Metric:** A significant increase in qualified leads for Enterprise Support, measured by submissions of the "Request a Quote" form.
*   **Community Metric:** A measurable decrease in support requests related to finding documentation, tracked via search analytics showing higher success rates on the first query.
*   **Engagement Metric:** Increased time-on-page and lower bounce rates for the "Our Impact" and "About Us" sections, indicating visitors are connecting with the ISC story.
*   **Trust Metric:** An increase in direct and branded search traffic, showing that ISC is becoming a primary destination rather than just a search result.

### 5. Content Strategy: The ISC Knowledge Hub

The new site will be more than a documentation library; it will be a resource. We will establish the **ISC Knowledge Hub**, a central place for expert-written content that educates and informs the entire internet community. This will include:

*   **Deep Dives:** Articles from ISC engineers explaining the "why" behind protocol changes and software architecture decisions.
*   **Historical Perspectives:** Telling the story of the internet's growth through the lens of BIND and ISC's involvement.
*   **Best Practices:** Authoritative guides on securing and optimizing DNS and DHCP infrastructure.

This strategy reinforces their thought leadership, provides immense value to the community, and creates a powerful engine for organic search traffic.

### 6. SEO Ambitions

The new ISC website will **own its digital territory**. We will rank #1 for our brand and product names. Beyond that, we will become the top-ranking authoritative resource for strategic, high-intent keywords that our audiences search for, including:

*   `BIND 9 documentation`
*   `Kea DHCP server`
*   `enterprise DNS support`
*   `commercial BIND support`
*   `internet standards non-profit`
*   `history of DNS`

We are not just building a website; we are building the definitive online resource for the technologies ISC stewards.
